# Webspejd: Check-in and -out system for Danish scout competition CCMR

WARNING: There are, at the moment, critical errors related to manual check-in and -out from the master page.
--
This Node JS server host a website that handles check-in and -out of scout
patrols for the Danish scout competition [CCMR](https://ccmr.dk/). It can be
setup to handle any number of locations and groups as long as the groups are to
be checked in and out of locations in a predefined order. There can be one or
zero skippable locations between compulsory locations.

## Overview
This project includes both Typescript source code along with the *compiled*
JavaScript code for a Node JS server. Typescript is found within the folder
`Development` whilst JavaScript and data is found within `Deployed`.  When
running, the server host multiple sites:
- a login page
- a check-in and out page for each location
- a master page that can see which check-in and -outs for all patrols on all locations

## Dependencies
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org)

## Usage
1. Compile the project by running `npx tsc` in the root directory.
2. Run the server `node target/server.js [hostname] [port]`
These instructions are for windows only.
[Node](https://nodejs.org) must be installed on the hosting machine. 

**Tip**: Both login-page and location-pages are developed solely for phones.
When developing or using on computer, it is therefore recommended to select a
phone device under development options within the browser.

**Tip**: To have the server accessible from the internet, use your local
ip-adresss as hostname. Setup port forwarding on your router to route any
incoming traffic on a chosen port (80 is standard for HTTP) to the hosting
machine on the port chosen within `server.js`. This wont work if you're behind
a NAT. See [this post](https://superuser.com/questions/1630106/how-do-i-find-out-if-my-isp-has-put-me-behind-a-nat-will-dynamic-dns-work-with)
to check if you're behind one. If you are, a tool like
[ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) can help you.

## Setup of data files
At the moment, setup must be done manually by editing a few JSON files located in `data`. The files are:

| File            | Information within                                                                                                                                |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `loeb.JSON`     | All patrols and whether they are still active                                                                                                     |

| `users.JSON`    | Login information along with passwords for each location                                                                                          |
